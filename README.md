# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The following analysis looks at PyBer's ride-sharing app data. For this analysis, the data was grouped according to city type (urban, suburban, and rural).

The following is the list of data visualizations that were delivered for the analysis of the PyBer ride-share app data:
* Bubble chart for all city types' ride-share data
* Box and whisker plots showing all city types for:
    * Ride count
    * Ride fare
    * Driver count
* Pie charts representing each city type's percentage of:
    * Total fares
    * Total rides
    * Total drivers

To further enhance the analysis, a summary-level data frame was created to show the following for each city type:
* Total rides
* Total drivers
* Total fares
* Average fare per ride
* Average fare per driver

Finally, a multiple-line plot for the sum of the fares for each city type was created.
